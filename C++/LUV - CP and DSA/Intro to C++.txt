-> In C++ endl eqv to '\n'

-> In both C and C++, '' (empty char) is an invalid literal.

->In C++ and latest versions of C, void main is invalid,i.e., main should have some return type.

->Usage of <bits/stdc++.h>:- 
*Pros:-
(i) Convenience: Includes all standard libraries, which means you don't need to include each library separately.
(ii) Speed in Coding: Useful in competitive programming where the time to write and test code is crucial.
*Cons:-
(i) Compile Time: Increases compile time because it includes all the libraries, even those not used in the program.
(ii) Portability: Not portable to non-GCC compilers or environments where bits/stdc++.h is not available.
(iii) Maintenance: Including unnecessary libraries can lead to maintenance issues and potentially longer build times in larger projects.

-> The using namespace std line can be omitted and replaced with the std keyword, followed by the :: operator for string (and cout) 
objects.

-> There is also a "for-each loop", which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array
*Syntax
for (type variableName : arrayName) 
{
  // code block to be executed
}

* for each loop can't be iterated over two arrays simultaneuosly
