=> Exception Handling: Removed unnecessary try-except blocks and replaced them with condition checks. : why were they removed and replaced 
with conditionals?

->Error Semantics: Exceptions should represent truly exceptional cases or errors that are unexpected and not part of regular flow. Regular 
conditions (like a list being empty) are expected states and should be handled using conditionals.

=> Circular Doubly Linked List:-
-> Error code:
class Node:
    def __init__(self,data=None,next=self,prev=self):
        self.data=data
        self.next = next
        self.prev = prev

->Error:
The Node class you provided appears to be intended for use in a doubly linked list, but there are some issues with the constructor's 
parameters, specifically with the default values for next and prev. Setting the default values to self will result in a NameError since 
self is not defined when the default values are evaluated.

->See the corrected code in the file(usage of comprehensions aka(case specific) ternary operator.
