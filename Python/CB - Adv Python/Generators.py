# Use of Generators
'''
-> Whenever a normal function gives back value to calling function via the means of "yeild" then that function
name becomes "Generator obj".
->  The yield statement remembers the point where the function last returned a value and resumes from that point the
next time itâ€™s called. This automatic state management makes generators simpler and more concise.
